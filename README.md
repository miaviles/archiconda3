# Archiconda3

## Intro

Archiconda3 is a distribution of conda for 64 bit ARM. Anaconda is a free and open-source distribution of the Python and R programming languages for scientific computing (data science, machine learning applications, large-scale data processing, predictive analytics, etc.), that aims to simplify package management and deployment. Like Virtualenv, Anaconda also uses the concept of creating environments so as to isolate different libraries and versions. \
 \
The goal of this repository is develop the groundwork needed to compile conda-forge on aarch64. Once that is layed out, we will be working toward backporting much of this work to conda-forge

## Setup

Since Archiconda3 is tailored for ARM64 computer, ths setup process is different from the one with the normal Anaconda. To start off, please follow the setup instructions below: \
